# multi-agent cooperation using emergent communication: 

* multi-agent reinforcment learning
* emergent-social-structures

Project describing how social complexity relates to communication complexity. Each agent gets a cropped portion of an image and have to cooperate with other agents to reach a prediction. A group of agents combine to form a community. Based on the input they recieve, they can either be a image-community or a text community.
